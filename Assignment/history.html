        <p>Xewkija, which is situated between Għajnsielem and the capital city, Victoria, is the oldest village in Gozo. It became the first parish outside Victoria on 27 November 1678. It was separated from the Matrix by Bishop Miguel Jerónimo de Molina and Dun Grezz Farrugia from Valletta, became its first parish priest. It became the first district 'contrada' to be known as 'casale' or village.</p>
        <p>The Rotunda of Xewkija is the Seat of the Knights of the Order of St. John, and was built from Maltese stone by local masons and craftsmen. It is the largest in Gozo and its dome dominates the village. Its architect was Ġużè Damato. It replaced an older church. The titular statue of Saint John the Baptist was sculpted in wood by Pietro Paolo Azzopardi in 1845. </p>
        <p>On the site where the present church is, it was said that there was a stone known as 'Maqgħad ix-Xiħ. Near it there is a small ancient chapel known as Madonna tal-Ħniena (Our Lady of Charity) which was dedicated to San Bartilimew.</p>

        <p>The Santa Cecilia Tower had been in the limits of Xewkija. There is another tower with the oldest sundial in Xewkija. Remains of Tinghi Tower disappeared in the 20th century. These towers date back to 1613. The Gourgion Tower, which was built in 1690, was demolished during the Second World War to make way for an airstrip.</p>
        <p>The Majmuna Stone with an Arabic inscription dating back to 1174 was found in Xewkija. It commemorates the death of an Arab girl named Maymūnah. The inscription is carved in a marble slab, on the underside of which there is a Roman symbol. Brother Gabrijel D'Alappo translated it into Italian and it was later translated into Maltese. </p>
        <p>The Banda Prekursur is the oldest organization in Xewkija. Lorenzo Zammit Haber, Marcell Mercieca, Giuseppe Buttigieg, Giovanni Haber and Tomaso Attard were among its founders. Mr.Lorenzo Zammit Haber was first President.The coat of arms of Xewkija is a shield on a gold background with a red horizontal strip between two thorns. The motto of Xewkija is 'Nemo me impune lacessit', meaning, 'No one shall attack me with impunity'.<p>

        <p>The Tigers have a very positive history in local football and for many seasons they were among the contenders for the honours in Gozo. Xewkija Tigers can trace their foundation to 1939. Yet it was 5 years after that, that they played their first competitive match. The Xewkija Tigers first participated in the local competitions during the 1944-45 season mainly due to the difficulties Gozitans suffered during the World War II.</p>
        <p>Xewkija Tigers' first domestic league honour came at the end of the 1974–75 season. This squad included the likes of: John Busuttil, Mike Apap, Salvu Cilia, Charlie Le Prevost, Frank Mizzi, Carmel Attard, Raymond Rapa, Paul Vella, John Spiteri, Wistin Scerri, John Attard, Carmel Portelli, Benny Vella, Paul Hili, Joe Debrincat and Joe Grech. The club was in the hands of President Mr. Frans Zammit Haber.</p>
        <p>In the early 1980s (1982–83 and 1983–84) Xewkija Tigers managed to win 2 consecutive league titles, together with the GFA Cup and the Silver Jubilee Cup. The team managed to win all the titles which the Gozitan league offered in these years. Xewkija were managed by Mr. Salvu Cilia.</p>
